This software computes the quantization determinant involving
the box matrix B and the Ktilde matrix which relates two-particle
interaction energies in finite volume to the scattering matrix.
An overview of this software is given in the paper below:

**NOTE:** The normalization of box matrix elements was changed in https://github.com/ebatz/TwoHadronsInBox/commit/f5f372f8ffc09f217cdb2796685b1e8551251be5 compared to the above reference. The consequences for the K matrix normalization are explained in the commit message.


See comments in the header files for information on each class
and required XML forms.

   File           Important classes
   ----           -----------------
box_quant.h       BoxQuantization, DecayChannelInfo
box_matrix.h      BoxMatrix
K_matrix_info.h   KElementInfo, KIndex, KFitParamInfo

There are two sample driver programs "driver1.cc" and "driver2.cc".
"driver1.cc" creates the needed objects from XML input given in
"input1.xml".  "driver2.cc" creates the objects in the code itself.

Tables of the block diagonal basis states and explicit expressions
for the box matrix elements are given in the file "box_matrix.pdf".
